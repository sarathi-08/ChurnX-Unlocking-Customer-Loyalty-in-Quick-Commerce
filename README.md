# ChurnX: Unlocking Customer Loyalty in Quick Commerce ðŸš€

Welcome to **ChurnX**, where we predict customer churn before it happensâ€”because in the world of quick commerce, losing customers faster than your delivery time is not just unfortunate, itâ€™s a disaster.

---

## ðŸ§  Abstract
In the high-stakes world of quick commerce platforms (think Blinkit, Zepto, and Swiggy Instamart), customer churn is the silent killer. This project uses machine learning (Random Forest Classifier), Power BI dashboards, and SQLite storage to predict which users are about to abandon ship. With features like "Days Since Last Order" and "Delivery Issues," we give businesses a fighting chance to retain their most valuable customers before they vanish.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Predict customer churn with a reasonable degree of certainty (because guesses aren't good enough).  
- Identify the key indicators of churnâ€”like delivery dissatisfaction and forgotten orders.  
- Visualize churn trends because everyone loves a good chart, even if it's a sad one.  
- Help businesses minimize churn, maximize loyalty, and ultimately, survive in this cutthroat market.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features
- A Random Forest model with **66.5% accuracy** (itâ€™s low, but thatâ€™s the reality of working with a simulated datasetâ€”real-world data would likely perform better).  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering thatâ€™s as clean as it gets.  
- A Power BI dashboard that provides insights you actually want to see (if you like knowing why people leave).  
- SQLite for lightweight data storageâ€”because no one has time for complicated databases.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
- SQLite (light on resources, heavy on practicality)  
- Power BI for presenting hard truths in pretty colors

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- **Model Accuracy:** 66.5% (yes, itâ€™s not stellarâ€”blame the simulated dataset. But hey, itâ€™s a start).  
- **Key churn predictors:** Recency of orders, delivery issues, discount usage.  
- Because nothing says "I'm leaving" quite like a delayed delivery or expired coupon.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Dive deeper with advanced models like XGBoostâ€”because why settle for just "good enough"?  
- Real-time churn predictionâ€”because who doesnâ€™t like to be one step ahead of their customers?  
- Expand the dataset with new features that might just save your business from total collapse.

> No patent, no conference paper (yet)â€”but hey, the project works, and it's live for anyone to use. Sometimes, execution is more important than publication.

# ðŸŒŸ Thanks for checking out ChurnXâ€”where customers leave and we catch them before they go. 
Because, frankly, no one likes being left in the dust.
